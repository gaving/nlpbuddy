      "SAMPLE CASE FILE: Amanda Knox Overview of the Case: In the Fall of 2007, 22-year-old British student Meredith Kercher and her 22-year-old American roommate, Amanda Knox, were studying in the sleepy town of Perugia, Italy. On November 1st, Kercher was found brutally stabbed to death in their apartment, and Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were accused of the crime. Although there was considerable evidence against Knox, many believe she was an innocent girl unjustly convicted of murder by a corrupt system. Crime Scene: The murder was committed in Kercher and Knox’s rental apartment which they shared with two Italian students while attending classes at the University for Foreigners at the University of Perugia. In a community comprised of 34,000 students, 3,000 being foreign students, the surrounding neighborhood is full of bars and inexpensive restaurants for students. On the night of November 1, 2007, Kercher was found on the floor of her bedroom, strangled, stabbed in the neck and partially unclothed with 47 cuts and bruises on her body (Kington 1). Blood was found at the scene and in the bathroom. According to the London Guardian, the window was broken from the inside, suggesting an attempt to fake a robbery. Footprints were also found under the body. The murder weapon, a bloody knife, was left at the scene. Suspects: Amanda Knox was the prime suspect in the case. Originally from Seattle, Washington, at the time of Kercher's murder, Knox was a 20-year-old University of Washington language student. She was in Perugia attending the University for Foreigners for one year, studying Italian, German and creative writing. It was at University that Knox met the victim, as well as Raffaele Sollecito, who later became her boyfriend, and another suspect in the crime. Sollecito is from Giovinazzo, Bari, and was 23 years old at the time of the murder. He was pursuing a degree in computer engineering at the University of Perugia when he met Knox. He is from an affluent family, the son of a urologist from Italy (Rizzo, 2009, p.1). A third suspect in the case was Rudy Hermann Guede. Guede was aged 20 at the time of the murder. He was originally from the Ivory Coast, and had come to Perugia at the age of five with his father, who worked as a laborer in the 1990s. At the age of 16, when his father left Italy, Guede was informally adopted by the family of a local businessman. Guede had acquired joint Italian nationality and studied accounting and hotelkeeping. He also played basketball for the Perugia youth team in the 2004–2005 season. He often stayed with his aunt who lived in Lecco, near Milan, and sometimes worked in Milan bars, returning occasionally to Perugia. According to Nadeau (2007), Guede had no criminal record at the time of the murder, and was the bouncer at the bar where Knox and Kercher spent much of their time. Evidence: There was considerable evidence against all three suspects, who were eventually convicted of the crime. For instance, a bloody handprint found on a pillow under the victim's back was matched to Guede. His DNA was also found in several locations in the bedroom: on and inside Kercher's body; on her shirt and bra; mixed with her blood splatter; and on her handbag. Guede's DNA was also found on toilet paper in one of the bathrooms but no trace of his DNA was found anywhere else in the flat, including the bedroom where the window had been broken and the contents ransacked. Other forensic evidence included an analysis of the metal clasp of Kercher's bra (retrieved in a second forensic search on 18 December 2007),] which revealed small traces of DNA matching Sollecito and three other unidentified people. At trial, Sollecito's lawyers argued that the unidentified people could have included the other two defendants, and that the delay in retrieving the sample could have led to contamination. From a detailed examination of the room with the broken window, investigators concluded that the apparent break-in had been staged, partly because the window seemed to have been broken after the room had been ransacked.[ Footprints were also found in the apartment, compatible with the feet of Knox and Sollecito. Knox's DNA was found mixed with Kercher's blood in the footprints and elsewhere in the apartment. A further footprint, believed to be a woman's, was found under the body. It was the right size to be Knox's, although it was never matched to her footwear. Knox's DNA was also found on a kitchen knife, recovered from Sollecito's apartment, and Kercher's DNA was found on the blade. Apart from the knife, there was no forensic evidence, such as DNA, hair, fibre, blood or skin, directly indicating that Knox had been in the bedroom where Meredith Kercher was sexually assaulted and murdered. The only fingerprints of Knox which were found anywhere in the apartment were those on a glass in the kitchen sink. Knox's fingerprints were not found in Kercher's bedroom, nor her own bedroom. For this reason, many believe that she was not guilty of the crime, and that her conviction was motivated by Anti-American sentiment at the time of the trial. Conclusion: Based on the evidence, it seems likely that Rudy Guede was guilty of Kercher’s murder. There is tremendous forensic evidence linking him to the crime. Although there was some evidence of Knox’s DNA at the scene, this is to be expected, as she lived in the apartment at the time. There is also a lack of motive for Kno x to have killed Kercher. Why would she sexually assault her roommate? There is nothing in her past to indicate that she might commit such deviant behavior. At the time of the case, Knox’s odd behavior and the anti-American sentiment in Europe might have biased the jury. Knox’s family is appealing the case. In the end, the murder was a tragic occurrence that was never satisfactorily solved. Reference List: Rizzo, A. (2009, March 22). Witness Contradicts Kercher Testimony."

      "REPORTING OFFICER'S NARRATIVE (Brief narrative of the facts surrounding the offense and the arrest.) At 6:15 a.m., Dispatch received a 911 call regarding the discovery of a dead body at the Yoknapatawpha County Convention Center at 1710 Belk Boulevard. The caller identified herself as Yvonne Boyd (Person 2), YCCC Accommodation Manager. Yoknapatawpha County Sheriff's Unit 209 (Officer P. Winston) was dispatched and arrived at the scene at 6:23 a.m. After confirming the presence of the body, R/O secured the scene and contacted Dispatch and requested backup and medical assistance. Reporting Investigators (R/Is) Detectives S. Murphy and E. Parker were assigned and proceeded directly to the scene. At R/Is' request, Coroner’s Inspector L. Johnson and a CSU team were notified to respond to the scene. R/Is arrived at the scene at 6:57 a.m. and found that R/O had secured the area. Environmental conditions at the scene upon arrival are as follows: Weather: Exterior Ambient Temperature: 46°F/ 8°C; Relative Humidity: 53%; Interior Ambient Temperature 68°F / 20°C; Interior Relative Humidity: 40%. R/O Winston made the following verbal report, which is stated in summary and not verbatim. R/O entered the YCCC through the main entrance was directed by front desk personnel to a hallway outside the fitness room, where R/O was met by an adult female who identified herself as Yvonne Boyd (Person 2). On the floor in the hallway was the body of an adult male, who Boyd identified as Jared Plunk (Person 1). At R/O's request, Boyd exited the area and returned to the main entrance to direct backup and medical personnel to R/O's location. R/O then secured the scene and cleared the area, finding no other persons present in the vicinity. R/O said YCFD EMTs R. Peterson and J. Bilkey arrived at approximately 6:31 a.m., and after confirming the victim was deceased, withdrew from the crime scene. R/O further stated that, to the best of his knowledge, the following personnel had occasion to enter the crime scene area and must be documented by CSU personnel: witness Yvonne Boyd, EMTs Peterson and Bilkey, and himself. Click to enlarge Click to enlarge After receiving the report from R/O Winston, R/Is conducted a preliminary inspection of the scene. In the hallway between the elevator and the fitness room, R/Is observed a lifeless human body, a male estimated to be in his mid to late 40s, lying prone on the floor. Visual inspection indicated the victim was wearing a dark blue jacket, white shirt, and dark blue pants. The legs were slightly apart with the right leg straight and the left leg bent at the hip and knee. The left arm was bent and slightly under the body with the hand approximately 1-inch from the face. The right arm was extended perpendicular to the body and bent nearly 90° at the elbow with the right hand extended above the head. The head was to the north and the feet to the south. Further visual inspection revealed the front and the back of the jacket and shirt were saturated with what appeared to be blood. R/Is observed multiple injuries to the back, chest and right forearm. R/Is delayed further inspection of the body until the arrival of the Coroner's Inspector. R/Is observed an overturned trash container and a scrap of paper on the floor near the body. No other items were immediately visible in the vicinity. CSU will conduct a thorough examination and inventory, and report their findings. Coroner's Inspector Luwinda Johnson arrived at the scene at approximately 7:10 a.m. and joined R/Is at the body's location. Inspector Johnson pronounced the victim deceased at 7:24 a.m. by visual observation that the victim was not breathing and by tactile observation that the victim did not have a palpable carotid pulse or any other indications of heartbeat or respiration. Inspector Johnson visually examined the body and observed what appeared to be multiple sharp force injuries to the back, chest and right forearm as well as a blunt force injury to the right side of the head. Inspector Johnson noted that rigor mortis was not yet evident and early indications of livor mortis were observable on the anterior of the body and the right side of the face. While she withheld an official estimate pending an autopsy, Inspector Johnson speculated the victim had been dead approximately 2 to 4 hours. Inspector Johnson indicated that further details would be available in the official autopsy report. After Inspector Johnson completed her initial inspection of the body, she stayed with the CSU team to ensure the integrity of the body while the team took photographs of the scene and performed preliminary analyses, until the body could be removed from the scene without affecting other evidence. CSU arrived at the scene at approximately 7:35 a.m. R/Is instructed CSU to process the entire scene according to standard procedure. A preliminary search of the immediate area for potential weapon(s) causing the injuries to the victim met with negative results. CSU will conduct a more intensive search and report their findings. Body of the deceased was remanded into the custody of Coroner's Inspector Luwinda Johnson and was removed from the scene at 10:27 a.m. and transported to the coroner's office for autopsy.

    title: "3. Rafael Caro Quintero",

      "Rafael Caro Quintero (born October 3, 1952) is a Mexican drug trafficker who co-founded the now-disintegrated Guadalajara Cartel with Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and other drug traffickers in the 1970s. He is the brother of fellow drug trafficker Miguel Caro Quintero, the founder and former leader of the defunct Sonora Cartel. Having formed the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1970s, Caro Quintero worked with Gallardo, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Pedro Avilés Pérez by shipping large quantities of marijuana to the United States from Mexico. He was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena, Camarena's pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, the American writer John Clay Walker, and dentistry student Alberto Radelat in 1985. After the murders, Caro Quintero fled to Costa Rica but was later arrested and extradited back to Mexico, where he was sentenced to 40-years in prison for murder.[1] Following his arrest, the Guadalajara Cartel disintegrated, and its leaders were incorporated into the Tijuana Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel, and Juárez Cartel. Caro Quintero was freed from jail on August 9, 2013, after a state court concluded that he had been tried improperly. However, amid pressure from the federal government of the United States to re-arrest him, a Mexican federal court issued an arrest warrant against Caro Quintero on August 14. He remains at large, as a wanted fugitive in Mexico, the United States, and several other countries. The United States is offering a $20 million bounty for his arrest. Rafael Caro Quintero was born in the community of La Noria, Badiraguato, Sinaloa, on October 3, 1952.[3] His parents, Emilio Caro Payán and Hermelinda Quintero, had twelve children; he was the oldest of the males. His father worked in agriculture and grazing, and died when Caro Quintero was 14 years old. With his father's absence, he worked to take care of his family alongside his mother.[4] At the age of 16, he left La Noria and settled in Caborca, Sonora, where he worked in livestock grazing.[5] Two years later, he worked as a truck driver in Sinaloa.[6] He also worked at a bean and corn plantation in Sinaloa before deciding to leave his home state to join the drug trade altogether in the neighboring state of Chihuahua.[7] When he was a teenager, Caro Quintero allegedly began to grow marijuana on a low scale, at the ranch owned by his brother Jorge Luis. In less than five years, Caro Quintero managed to buy several other ranches in the surrounding areas and began to amass a fortune. He is said to have first worked for the drug traffickers Pedro Avilés Pérez and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo before forming the Guadalajara Cartel with Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, and others in the late 1970s.[6][7][8] He has been cited as a pioneer of the drug trade in Mexico and has been described as one of the preeminent drug traffickers of his generation.[9][10] Caro Quintero has also been accused of involvement in the murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena Salazar. In November 1984, the Mexican authorities raided a 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) ranch known as El Búfalo in the state of Chihuahua, owned by Caro Quintero.[5] The authorities reportedly burned more than 10,000 tons of marijuana – totaling a loss of around $160 million.[12][14] Camarena, who had been working undercover in Mexico, was said to be responsible for leading the authorities to the ranch. This allegedly prompted Caro Quintero and other high-ranking members of the Guadalajara Cartel to seek revenge against the DEA and Camarena.[15] In retribution, Camarena and his pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar were allegedly kidnapped in Guadalajara on February 7, 1985, brutally tortured, and murdered.[16] Caro Quintero then left Mexico on March 9, 1985 with his associates and his girlfriend Sara Cristina Cosío Gaona.[12] Former Mexican Judicial Police chief Armando Pavón Reyes, after receiving a $300,000 bribe, reportedly allowed Caro Quintero to flee from the airport in Guadalajara, in a private jet, to seek refuge in Costa Rica. The police chief was fired shortly afterward, and was charged with bribery and complicity in the Camarena murder.[17]"

      "Robert William Fisher (born April 13, 1961)[1] is an American fugitive wanted for the alleged murder of his wife and two children, and blowing up the house in which they lived in Scottsdale, Arizona on April 10, 2001. He was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives on June 29, 2002.[2] Contents 1 Early life 2 Family life 2.1 Marital troubles 3 Triple murder and arson 4 Investigation 5 In popular culture 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Early life Robert William Fisher was born in Brooklyn, New York[2] in 1961 to William Fisher, a banker, and Jan Howell. He has two sisters and attended Sahuaro High School in Tucson, Arizona. His parents divorced in 1976, when he was 15. According to friends and relatives, the divorce was very difficult, leaving long-lasting effects on Fisher. He spoke of it with coworkers at Mayo Clinic Hospital, and confided to one associate that his life could have been different if his mother had not left the family.[3] Family life Fisher, a U.S. Navy veteran, married Mary Cooper in 1987.[4] He has worked as a surgical catheter technician, respiratory therapist, and firefighter, and is an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and fisherman.[2] Fisher was described as a cruel and distant control freak of a father who was awkward with his children,[5] but tried to hold on to an image as a devoted family man.[3] His mother-in-law, Ginny Cooper, told investigators that, Fisher didn't socialize often with family because of a fear of getting too close to people and losing them.[6] Fisher's mother told investigators that she had been a yes-sir wife who didn't stand up to her husband. She added that she saw similar dynamics early in her son's marriage to Mary, and had talked to her about her concerns. One close friend of Fisher stated that his family resembled his childhood family.[3] Marital troubles Fisher had been an active member of the Scottsdale Baptist Church's men's ministry, but unlike Mary, he had begun to withdraw from its activities a few months prior to the murders.[6] In 1998, the Fishers went to their church's senior pastor for marital counseling. Fisher told coworkers about a one-night affair with a prostitute he met in a massage parlor. He fretted that Mary would find out that it was the cause of a urinary tract infection that left him ill for several days in December 2000.[3][5] Fisher told a hunting mate that he was renewing his commitment to his faith and marriage because he could not live without his family, possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is not unusual for an individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent.[3] In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends that she was going to divorce Fisher.[5] A neighbor reported hearing a loud argument on April 9, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before their house blew up in an explosion.[6] Triple murder and arson On the morning of April 10, 2001, Mary was shot in the back of the head and her children's throats were slashed from ear to ear in the hours before their house exploded at 8:42am.[6] Firefighters were immediately alerted to the explosion, which was strong enough to collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for a half-mile (800 m) in all directions.[7] Firefighters kept the 20-foot (6 m)-high blaze from spreading to other homes. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.[7] The gas line from the back of the house's furnace had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal evidence of the homicides. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate ten hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. The burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed[6] in the remains of the burnt out house.[7] They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10).[6] Investigators theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he did as a child.[5] Bobby Fisher.jpg Investigation Fisher, who disappeared at the time of the murders, was named as an official (and to date, only) person of interest in the case on April 14, 2001, when Arizona Department of Public Safety officers were instructed in a statewide bulletin to arrest him. On April 20, the last physical evidence of Fisher's whereabouts surfaced, when police found Mary's Toyota 4Runner and their dog, Blue, in Tonto National Forest, near the town of Young, Arizona, a hundred miles north of Scottsdale.[8][9] Although police searched the area around where the car was found, it has been alleged that they did not search the nearby network of caves sufficiently. Several professional cavers have suggested that Fisher used these as a hiding place, before either escaping, killing himself or dying from low oxygen levels.[10] On July 19, a state arrest warrant was issued in Phoenix, charging Fisher with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson. Subsequently, he was declared a fugitive, and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.[2] On June 29, 2002, Fisher was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. He was also on the America's Most Wanted Dirty Dozen list of the show's most notorious fugitives, and was profiled on The Hunt with John Walsh. The FBI offers a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his capture.[2] As of April 2003, FBI had received hundreds and hundreds of leads.[11] However, all reported sightings of Fisher have been inconclusive or false.[4] In February 2004, an individual with a striking physical resemblance to Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Fingerprints eventually confirmed that he was not Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him.[4] The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in Gila County, Arizona.[12] In October 2014, police raided a house in Commerce City, Colorado after receiving a tip that Fisher was hiding there. Despite arresting two occupants, they did not find any sign of Fisher.[13] Fisher is considered armed and extremely dangerous and has ties to Florida and New Mexico.[2] There has been speculation that he has committed suicide or started a new life under an assumed identity.[5][14] FBI agent Caldwell's sense of his personality and habits is that he is arrogant. He's cocky. He's a know-it-all...and a loner. He chews tobacco and favors the Copenhagen brand, sometimes walks in an odd, erect manner with his chest out due to back pain, and is an avid hunter and fisherman.[11] In April 2016, FBI officials and Scottsdale police displayed new age-enhanced photos of Fisher during a news conference on the fifteenth anniversary of the murders.[15][16] FBI-age-enhanced-photos-of-Robert-William-Fisher.jpg"
